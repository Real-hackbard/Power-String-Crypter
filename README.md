In multi-layer encryption, an already encrypted message is encrypted one or more times using the same or a different algorithm. It is also known as cascade encryption, cascade cipher, multi-layer encryption, and super-encryption. Super-encryption refers to encryption at the outer layer of a multi-layer encryption.

Some cryptographers, such as Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins University, say that multi-layer encryption solves a problem that largely doesn't exist:
